	description `Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago. There is a reason why the Firebird has been revered in all corners of human space as a warship capable of dealing with any situation. It only makes sense to utilize alien technology when you are capable of traveling beyond Human space, the result is a fearsome display of force with enough firepower to punch well above its own weight.`
