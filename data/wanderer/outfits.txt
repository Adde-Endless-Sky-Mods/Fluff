	description `The construction of the new Scud drones prompted a need for an even smaller engine complement than was available at the time. This led to the creation of the Type 0 Radiant Engine, the Wanderers' first-ever hybrid engines systems, capable of achieving speeds comparable to a set of Type 1 engines whilst remaining significantly smaller.`
	description `This efficiency serves as a reminder to the Wanderers that their engineering has not stagnated, and that they are still capable of progressing their technology.`
